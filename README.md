SETUP: 
    -> pip3 install requirements.txt
    -> copy the required_files folder and extract.py to your current working directory
    -> python3 extract.py


INPUT: 
    This script takes all the CVEs from 'Jan 31 CVEs.xlsx' as input and compares it with 'APT Groups.xlsx','Exploit-DB Master Scrape.xlsx','NVD Updated Data.xlsx','R@n$0mw@rE.xlsx'

    - if you want to change the input file, you have to update
        line 13: ps = openpyxl.load_workbook('required_files/$new_file_name$.xlsv')
        line 33: cve_array.append(sheet['B'+str(row)].value) ie.. in this CVE column is "B", you have to update the respective column value from the updated file. 
    

OUTPUT: 
    extracted info can be put in a file as {CVE : value} format
        eg: CVE-2019-16057 : Cr1ptT0r

    you can change the ouput format by updating the function in line 450

        3.CWE id 
        4.CVSS score
